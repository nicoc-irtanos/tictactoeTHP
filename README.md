## Running the Tic-Tac-Toe

Clone this repository on your local machine

In your newly created repository run ``` bundle install ``` just in case

Run the file ``` tic_tac_toe.rb ``` using ``` ruby tic_tac_toe.rb ```

## Into the Program

Set the name of the first player

Set the name of the second player

Each time, the mentioned player must type in the terminal the number corresponding to the cell he or she wants to fill

See who wins (or not!)

## Known imperfections

If a player wins whend filling the last case, shows draw mfw along with win

When winning, plays another turn and thus the other player can also win

If the user's input's is a number higher than 9, then the program crashes
